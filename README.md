# The real uncrackables 

## Challenges 

It seems that when it comes to mobile, real good challenges are very few out there. The real objective of a challenge is to actually learn something out of it and not keep hiding flags in the assets :). In fact some of the challenges won't have flags but real solutions as they will to be based on real  scenarios like: "hey, how you exploit this ?" 

I'll keep adding cool crackmes in this repo, so.. penterers and CTFers stay tuned....

## Challenge List

### [Four.apk](https://github.com/Ch0pin/uncrackable/blob/main/four.apk) (A shot of knowledge) 

```
The curious case of a file disappearance

The vulnerability assessment team informed the developers that 'Four' has a vulnerability 
which allows someone to write files anywhere in the application's data folder. The developer 
team though reassured that there is no danger and they took a cool measure to avoid the security 
risk. 

Can you change the "Connected to" to point to your server, without braking the sandbox ?

NO ADB, NO ROOT, NO FRIDA/OBJECTION solutions are accepted... Just plain user input
