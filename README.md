# The real uncrackables 



## Challenges 

It seems that when it comes to mobile, real good challenges are very few out there. The real objective of a challenge is to actually learn something out of it and not keep hiding flags in the assets :). In fact some of the challenges won't have flags but real solutions as they will to be based on real  scenarios like: "hey, how you exploit this ?" 

I'll keep adding cool crackmes in this repo, so.. penterers and CTFers stay tuned....
